      Avatar: The Last Airbender is an Emmy award-winning American animated
      television series that aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon and the
      Nicktoons Network. The series was created and produced by Michael Dante
      DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who served as executive producers along
      with Aaron Ehasz. Avatar is set in an Asian-influenced world of martial
      arts and elemental manipulation. The show drew on elements from East
      Asian, South Asian, and Western culture, making it a mixture of what were
      previously traditionally separate categories of Japanese anime and Western
      domestic cartoons.
