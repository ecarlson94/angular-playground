        Avatar: The Last Airbender is an Emmy award-winning American animated
        television series that aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon and the
        Nicktoons Network. The series was created and produced by Michael Dante
        DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who served as executive producers along
        with Aaron Ehasz. Avatar is set in an Asian-influenced world of martial
        arts and elemental manipulation. The show drew on elements from East
        Asian, South Asian, and Western culture, making it a mixture of what
        were previously traditionally separate categories of Japanese anime and
        Western domestic cartoons.
